# Foam-Patrol 

This is a project created to aid beginner and intermediate surfers, as well as those who want to learn how to surf. Foam Patrol has multiple pages for online courses, an interactive surf forecast, and a shop. The site is inspired by websites like [Barefoot Surf](https://barefootsurftravel.com/), [Magic Seaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/), and [Global Surf Industries](https://www.surfindustries.com/).

Draft version of Foam Patrol: [here](https://foam-patrol.netlify.app/)

## Project Description 

Tech Stack: Reactjs, HTML, CSS

Making this to cement development processes into memory, including state management, and API usage.

NOTE: Currently none of the groups who have made surf-related APIs are giving out API keys, so Foam Patrol will use weather APIs as a temporary alternative.

## TO DO 

Foam Patrol is a work in progress and needs the addition of the following: 

1. shop and a cart + ability to "order"
2. weather forecast that accesses user's current location to find nearest surfable beaches
3. CSS additions to make the app more user friendly
